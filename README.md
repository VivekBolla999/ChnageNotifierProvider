                              State management in flutter

Change notifier : A class called ChangeNotifier sends change notifications to its listeners. This implies that you can call the notifyListeners() method of a class that has been extended or combined with a ChangeNotifier to subscribe to changes in that class. The widgets that are subscribed to this class will be informed to rebuild by this function.

State notifier : On the other hand, StateNotifier is an immutable state management solution where the state can be directly changed within the notifier. It is an amplification of the ValueNotifier. Also, StateNotifier is an independent package that doesnâ€™t rely on Flutter, unlike ChangeNotifier, and it can be used within your Dart projects as well.



Difference between change notifier and state notifier:

Mutable state(objects are mutable)                                       
Dependent on flutter                            		                 
Time complexity is higher                   		                     
In the long run it is hard to manage code                               
Manually call notifylisteners()

immutable(objects are immutable)(modifies the state)
independent on flutter
time complexity is lower
easy to manage code in long
automatically calls
